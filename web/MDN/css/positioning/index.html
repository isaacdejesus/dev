    <h1>Basic document flow</h1>

    <p>The z index can be used to position items on the z axis. By default positioned elements
    have a z-index set to auto -> 0. By default elements coming later in the documents
    overlap previous elements. Currently, this p is being overlapped by next p. Setting this p
    z index to 1 will cause this p to float over other p.</p>

    <p class="positioned-relative">Paragraph is aligned used position: relative. Position can be controlled using top, left, right, bottom. 
    This P is positioned using top: 30px and left: 30px. Relative position, floats element relative to original position.</p>

    <p class="positioned-absolute">Paragraph is positioned using position: absolute; In absolute positioning, the positioning is in relation 
    to parent element. Due to element is taken out from normal flow and neighboring elements take over space left behind by absolute element
     . If no ancestors have their position defined then the default parent/contained against which absolute items will be positioned is
     the html element. Here, we will set the body's position: relative;, this will cause p to be positioned relative to body.</p>

    <p>inline elements <span>like this one</span> and <span>this one</span> sit on the same line as one another, and adjacent text nodes, if there is space on the same line. Overflowing inline elements <span>wrap onto a new line if possible â€” like this one containing text</span>, or just go on to a new line if not, much like this image will do: <img src="long.jpg"></p>
